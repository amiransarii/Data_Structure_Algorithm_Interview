 * Problem statement
Whis and Beerus are playing a new game today. They form a tower of 
N coins and make a move in alternate turns. Beerus plays first. 
In one step, the player can remove either 1, X, or Y coins from the tower. The person to make the last move wins the game. Can you find out who wins the game?

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10 ^ 6
2 <= X <= Y<= 50

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
4 2 3
Sample Output 1 :
Whis
Sample Input 2 :
10 2 4
Sample Output 2 :
Beerus
Explanation to Sample Input 1:
Initially, there are 4 coins,  In the first move, Beerus can remove
 either 1, 2, or 3 coins in all three cases, Whis can win by removing all the remaining coins.
