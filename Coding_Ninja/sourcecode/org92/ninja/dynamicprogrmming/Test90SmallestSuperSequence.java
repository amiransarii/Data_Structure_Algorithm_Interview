/*
 * Problem statement
 Given two strings S and T with lengths M and N. Find and return the length of their shortest 'Super Sequence'.

 The shortest 'Super Sequence' of two strings is defined as the smallest string possible
  that will have both the given strings as its subsequences.

Note :
If the two strings do not have any common characters, then return the sum of the lengths of the two strings. 
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Constraints :
0 <= M <= 10 ^ 3
0 <= N <= 10 ^ 3

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
ab
ac
Sample Output 1 :
3
Explanation of Sample Output 1 :
Their smallest super sequence can be "abc" which has length = 3.
Sample Input 2 :
pqqrpt
qerepct
Sample Output 2 :
9
