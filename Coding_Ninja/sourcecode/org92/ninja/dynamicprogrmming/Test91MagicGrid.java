 * Problem statement
You are given a magic grid A with R rows and C columns. In the cells of the grid, 
you will either get magic juice, which increases 
your strength by |A[i][j]| points, or poison, 
which takes away |A[i][j]| strength points. 
If at any point of the journey, the strength points become less than or equal to zero, then you will die.

You have to start from the top-left corner cell (1,1) 
and reach at the bottom-right corner cell (R,C). From a cell (i,j), 
you can only move either one cell down or right i.e., to cell (i+1,j) 
or cell (i,j+1) and you can not move outside the magic grid. 
You have to find the minimum number of strength points with which you will be able to reach the destination cell.
